# Flood-Image-Segmentation
This repository contains keras (module in python) and Fastai (module in PyTorch) implementation of a U-Net model for segmenting flood water in Hurricane Harvey  satellite images. The U-Net architecture is a popular choice for image segmentation tasks, particularly for biomedical and satellite imagery.
